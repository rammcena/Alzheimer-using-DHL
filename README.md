# Alzheimer-using-DHL
Prediction of Alzheimer using ensemble methods of deep learninh and machine learning. 


The DHL model is comprised of both the  deep learning  and many machine learning algorithms such as CNN, k-means, naive bayes, random forest, and so on .Deep learning has the advantage of automatic feature extraction, so the CNN algorithm is used for the feature extraction of the dataset in the DHL model.
